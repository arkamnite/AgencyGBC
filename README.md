## A Windows emulator for the Game Boy / Game Boy Colour.

I've picked this project primarily as a means to gain practical experience with STL, SDL, and creating a real Windows application- all the while hopefully maintaining a development process in which I can quickly add features to the application whilst it is already 'in release' as it were. In practice, this will most likely represent itself as allowing me to emulate different parts of the GameBoy (and later the GBC variant) fully, as I make more and more progress.

## Current Status: Game Boy ðŸŽ®
### `general to-do list`
- [X] Implementing 8-bit opcodes (currently ~50% complete)
- [ ] Implementing 16-bit opcodes
- [X] Implement GUI
- [ ] Implement basic sprite table / OAM
- [ ] Implement sprite rendering
- [ ] Implement ROM reading
- [ ] Support wider range of ROMs
- [ ] Migrate to a Game Boy Colour

## Why is this not a private repository?

There are several good reasons to make this a private repository:
- I'm not expecting any contributors on a project that has been completed so many times by others.
- Any poor code practices I make would be publicly viewable. The mockery!

There are however even better reasons to in fact make this public:
- If anyone comes across this and decides they want to offer any suggestions, they can do.
- Preparing my work to be publicly viewable provides good incentive to avoid intentionally poor (read: lazy) habits.
- There is a certain amount of accountability involved which will hopefully make me motivate myself to keep on going, even when this gets tough.
- Any prospective employers/interviewers will be able to see the exact code referenced on my CV, which could aid any applications I make in the future.
- If and when I finish this project, someone starting out with emulation development may find my repository and could look at how I solved this problem.

Furthermore, I believe it's okay to make mistakes with code. I'm not a deity, I'm a normal student. A public project is a small way to get into the habit of trying new things regularly, and seeing where they go.

Wish me luck!
